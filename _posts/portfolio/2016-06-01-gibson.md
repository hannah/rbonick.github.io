Created [gibson], a minimal CSS framework, in a desire to learn more about how CSS frameworks are assembled. I also
found building it to be very beneficial to my CSS coding style and best practices. 

It is currently still under development.

Built on [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), a CSS preprocessor.
