### Super Mega Awesome Care-Tags Filter Extraordinaire

###### [Available on Github](https://github.com/rbonick/care-filter)

A Google Chrome extension that replaces words on web pages with the [care-tags.org](http://care-tags.org) approved
words using a filter system based off the [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) extension.

Filters were created by the [care-tags.org](http://care-tags.org) moderators, while I wrote the extension and
implemented a system to manage filters.
