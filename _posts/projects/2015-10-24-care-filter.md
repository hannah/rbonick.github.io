description: "A Google Chrome filter to replace words on webpages with \"better\" replacements."

Created a Google Chrome extension that replaces words on web pages with the [care-tags.org](http://care-tags.org) approved
words using a filter system based off the [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) extension.

Filters were created by the [care-tags.org](http://care-tags.org) moderators, while I wrote the extension and
implemented a system to manage filters.
