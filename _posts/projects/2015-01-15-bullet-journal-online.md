This was a winter break project to implement the concepts of a [Bullet Journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/) in an
website. [It's available on Heroku](http://bulletjournalonline.herokuapp.com/).

This allowed me to play around with some frameworks I had been wanting to work with for a while:
[Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a very minimal CSS framwork;
and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), an MVC Python framework.
