Created a collection of **Python** scripts focusing on scraping data off [care-tags.org](http://care-tags.org/index.php),
an online forum. Both utilize the [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and
[Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) libraries.

Due to increased popularity, the site is much more time-consuming to crawl. The scripts do not function as well as
they used to.
